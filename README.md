# Obsidian Evernote Decryptor

Manage encrypted data imported from Evernote.

Decryption method is based on the article: [Decoding the Evernote en-crypt field payload](https://soundly.me/decoding-the-Evernote-en-crypt-field-payload/).

## Usage

Select the encrypted data and click `Decrypt Evernote encrypted data`
in the context menu.

You can also run the command from the command palette or set a keyboard
shortcut for the command.

## Note

If you prefer to manage your data as encrypted within Obsidian,
[inline-encrypter](https://github.com/solargate/obsidian-inline-encrypter)
may be a good solution.
